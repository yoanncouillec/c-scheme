# Fun

Fun programming language is a scheme-like language.

The aim of Fun is not to build a revolutionary language. It's to show
the simplicity in designing a minimal functional programming language
but still very usable. Fun has those characteristics:

* **Functional:** Like OCaml, Haskell, Scala or Lisp, Fun is a
    functional programming language with all advantage of it, a very
    clear and clean expressivity focused on correctness.  
* **Dynamic typing:** Like Lisp or JavaScript (or even Python) typing
    is dynamic, meaning types are determined at runtime.
